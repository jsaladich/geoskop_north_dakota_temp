Specifically, this growth was more significant in the north and northeast of ND's state, involving the agricultural regions named North East (Towner, Cavalier, Pembina, Ramsey, Walsh, Nelson and Grand Forks), North Central (Botinneau, Rolette, McHenry, Pierce and Benson) and North West (Divide, Burke, Renville, Williams, Mountrail and Ward).<br>\n",

From one hand, there is a decreasing trend in which temperature falls below 12ÂºC, meaning that over the years soybean has had days with a temperature higher than 12ÂºC, and therefore, the positive trend manifested by the GDD is solid. On the other hand, it seems to be an increasing trend in the number of days with temperature over the optimal growth threshold, yet this trend can be confirmed since data is so disperse.<br>\n",

For example, the month of April 2021 in France has been disastrous for many farmers due to the continuous frosts, totally anomalous.<br>\n",

    "To summarize, this study explains why it is important to take the climate into account when making an investment decision in new farmland. It is important to highlight that the **climate is not static, but dynamic** and can have an impact on the profitability of an investment.\n",
    "Furthermore, assuming that historical climatology can be representative of the future is a common mistake, that is increasingly relevant since **Climate Change is accelerating the climate dynamics and therefore, lowering the predictability of the climate based only on historical behaviour**.<br>\n",
    "Regarding our study area, the northern region of North Dakota, we demonstrate that the trends of change in temperature have been favorable to soybeans growth. This is a proven fact, but it does not always have to be the case. They are considered favorable conditions for the following reasons:\n",
    "1) The heat accumulated by the crop has increased at a rythm of 9 GDD per year\n",
    "2) The presence of temperatures lower than 12ÂºC has decreased during the growing season\n",
    "3) No tendencies have been found regarding 3 days frost (extreme events)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the goal of this study is to raise awareness to agricultural decision makers and related stakeholders that the climate can negatively impact to financial projections of an investment. The study contains historical data only, yet in Geoskop we generate climate predictions, up to 40 years ahead, so the impact of the climate can be mitigated and the decision making process takes into account new vectors not considered up to date.\n",
